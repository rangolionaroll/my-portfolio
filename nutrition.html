									This project consists of 7 games that each cover a Nutrition topic and 
									have been designed for a kindergarten age group.  Currently,
									three of these games have been developed and shipped. As project 
									lead for these three games, I have seen them through, from scoping to delivery. 
									While each of these games had individual lesson objectives, overall they had the 
									goal of understanding how well a student was able to grasp the content and what
									ideas they struggled with. Read about the individual games below.

									For this game another team member came up with the concept.  This 
									included the two options for each question, the meter that counts 
									progress, the skeleton mascot and the story of the skelly needing 
									to power up to go play.  
									</br></br>
									
									I worked on taking the concept and completing it. I mapped out all the game 
									flows to make sure no pieces were missing as shown on the left and then used 
									that storyboard to collaborate with the artist and sound designer to organize 
									the art and sounds.
									</br></br>

									For example, the original
									storyboard showed the question and then showed a large coin on the 
									screen to indicate they had gotten the question right.  I completed this 
									flow by making the coin appear over the correct answer and fly to the
									skeleton meter.  It then became a snack that filled up the meter.

									<ul align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									Along with completing the game flows, an important part of this project 
									was an assessment of the students playing the game.  I decided to accomplish
									this in two ways.
									</br></br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									The first was through a certificate activity.  With a certificate at the end 
									of the game, the teachers could assess whether a student had completed the game.
									It also served as a fun takeaway for the students, which they could save and print.
									Rather than a plain certificate, I decided that it would be cool to add an activity
									to customize it.  For this game, that was coloring in Skelly and also decorating
									with different dairy products.  The storyboard and the UI that I created are shown below.
									</li>
									</br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									The second was through custom events during the game.  I designed and developed 
									the framework of the game to be able to collect information for things such as 
									how long a child took per question, to get a better idea of how the game is being
									played and what questions children struggled with most.</li>

									For this game I came up with the original concept.  One of the storyboard 
									images is shown.  The original concept had two portions, a 
									storybook and a quiz.
									With the storybook, the children would move along the story by interacting with 
									environmental elements such as the sun.  We decided to shorten the game and 
									take away the first activity.  
									</br></br>

									For the quiz section, the idea was that a food element would be introduced, and
									that the child would have to identify which element it is, on a generic plant.
									They would do this by clicking that part on the plant.  After working with 
									the designer, we found that for parts that are scattered on the plant, this might
									be a bit difficult, so we added tags that the player could interact with.  A sample 
									of our brainstorming is shown.
									</br></br>
									
									To keep the introduction interesting as the parts of a plant are being introduced, 
									we kept the buildup element but did that with the sound design.  With each plant 
									part, a new instrument is introduced to the soundtrack and then later in the quiz 
									section those same sounds are used to reinforce each plant part.  An example of this
									is shown in the video.

									They had the option to pick a design for each part of the plant.
									The storyboard and the completed product are shown below.

									For this game I came up with the original concept.  To change things up with 
									how the game would be played, I wanted to use a drag and drop concept rather 
									than clicking the correct option.  For this game, I decided to have the food 
									be dragged onto the plate into the correct food group.  With one of the 
									introductory prompts being about smiling, I also wanted the mascot to be a 
									shark for its many teeth.  Since the concept was about building plates using
									the myPlate food groups, I also wanted him to be a chef.
									</br></br>

									With this information our lead designer, came up with the concept of the shark
									working in a diner to build the plates.  He worked with me to rework the UI and
									the story so that it hit all the points I scoped and would also be fast to develop.
									The first concept sketch and the final product are shown.
