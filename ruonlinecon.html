									This project was designed for conference attendees at the 2019 
									Rutgers Online Learning Conference.  The theme of the conference was 
									Education eXtended, so we designed the game to showcase extended 
									reality.  We had a virtual reality, an augmented reality, and a real
									life activity for the conference attendees to complete in order to enter a raffle.
									They could also use the conference's mobile app to take pictures 
									and submit them to a photo gallery for an extra raffle entry.
									</br></br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									For our VR activity, we set up a 360 camera inside
									of a photobooth in which attendees could take a picture.  We also set up
									these images to be seen on an Oculus Go.
									</li>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									For our AR activity, I built a simple Vuforia set-up in Unity, in which 
									attendees could hold up the game flyer and a die and particle system
									would appear. They could move the flyer around to look at the different sides
									of the die and figure out which side was hidden.
									</li>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									For our real life activity, we created conference cards based on the 
									"Sneaky Cards" game.  We added prompts such as "create a collaborative doodle"
									that would get the players to pass on the cards to one another to promote 
									networking. Each attendee started out with two cards.
									</li>
									</br>
									Some images from the conference are shown below.

									I tabled this event for the duration of the conference and interacted 
									with many of the attendees who were curious about the game.  The largest 
									thing that I had noticed was that because the prizes (Oculus Go, 360 camera)
									were really cool, people wanted to enter the raffle, but they weren't as 
									enthusiastic about playing the entire game.  Many people did the AR activity 
									because it was quick.  Fewer people did the VR photobooth and even less
									people wanted to use the conference card game.  Many came to the table and asked
									if they could do the activity with us instead of talking to other conference 
									attendees. We got them to form a group to do the activity and talk to each other.
									What I noticed was that not many people wanted to go out of the way to do extra 
									activities.  They were there for the workshops and certainly focused on those.
									I took this to the team for the 2020 conference game which you can read about below.

									Keeping this in mind, we planned for the 2020 conference.  The theme for the 
									conference was "2020 Vision A View to the Future."  As part of our presentation
									at the conference we talked about the game design process and an augmented reality
									app that we had been working on.  As that app had been recieved well, we intended 
									on showcasing augmented reality in the conference app as well.  We decided on a 
									collection mechanic for the game in which attendees could scan different things and
									add objects to their "virtual classroom."  To build on the story all of these objects
									would be tools for teaching and learning. </br></br>Taking the feedback from last year, we knew
									that the game would have to be incorporated into the main conference app and activties
									so we outlined the things we would want to feature and promote. This included vendors,
									workshops and networking.  We would give vendors an AR target that people could scan by
									talking to them, have an AR target at the end of each workshop session, and include a 
									small variety of AR targets on attendee badges.  In order to collect them all, attendees 
									could ask if anyone had the object they were missing, and hopefully start a conversation.
									By merely attending the conference and participating in the conference activities, users
									could earn raffle tickets towards a prize.  Keeping in mind the 2020 vision theme, 
									we decided to have 3 groups of tools as well, the past, present and future. I proposed that 
									the story would follow attendees who all had tools from the past, eg. pencil, quill, typewriter.
									They would talk to the vendors and collect tools from the present which is what the vendors 
									offered.  Lastly, by attending the workshops they would get a glimpse into the future and 
									collect future tools.
									</br></br>
									Unfortunately, the conference was moved virtually due to Covid and the game was cut.  However,
									some brainstorming work is shown below.
