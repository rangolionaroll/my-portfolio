								<p>As a member of the Rutgers University Seeing Eye Puppy Raising Club for 3 years, 
								I was able to help raise many future guide dogs.  My involvement in the program 
								included doing basic obedience training, taking the puppies to classes and events, 
								and exposing them to a variety of new environments. I hope to be able to raise 
								a Seeing Eye puppy of my own in the near future. </p>

								<h2>Andy</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Andy was a German shepherd that I started sitting when he was 3 months old.  
							I was able to take him to my Linear Signals and Systems, and 2D Animation 
							classes on a weekly basis.  Being able to sit him regularly, I was able to take 
							notice of things that made him anxious, and slowly expose him to more stimulating 
							environments.  We went to events like corn mazes, basketball games, movies, 
							marathons and many more.  I was even able to take him to NYC for a weekend and 
							get him used to an environment with constant noise.</p>

								<h2>Johann</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Johann was a German shepherd that I started sitting when 
							he was 2 months old. I also took him to classes, work and 
							various events weekly. One of the events I took him to was Yule Log,
							which I was an organizer for. He kept up with my pace 
							during the event without drawing attention to himself.  He also accompanied 
							me to NYC, where we rode the subway, went to restaurants, and walked
							around the city.</p>
