								This project was designed to be a showcase for the possibilities of Augmented Reality technology.
								To tie into the topic of the conference, we wanted the objects we showcased to be relevant to
								college planning. Some of our goals and how we met them are outlined below. </br></br>
								<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									<strong> Create a unique way to experience the buildings on campus.</strong></br>
									The app served as a self-guided tour with game elements. Players
									take a role in which they are helping people find buildings on the campus.
									As they help these people, they themselves get acquainted with the campus.
									With 7 people to help, and an augmented reality map on which buildings show up as
									they are discovered, the game engages the player to complete the
									experience and explore the campus.
								</li> </br>
								<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									<strong> Demonstrate various uses of augmented reality technology.</strong></br>
									With 10 scannable targets, each had a unique 3D model or interaction.
									While some targets had a 3D model, image or video that represented them, others had mini-games,
									like a maze, a puzzle and a cannon the player could fire. Along with the signs created for each
									building, some targets from environmental elements were included. Read more in the
									<a href="#vuforia">Vuforia</a> section.
								</li> </br>
								<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
									<strong> Showcase the rich history of the buildings at Voorhees Mall. </strong></br>
									After researching all of the buildings in Voorhees Mall to find out more about their history, fun facts,
									flavortext and 3D models were created to showcase their past and present uses.

								One of the most interesting things for me with this project was
								photographing the buildings.  The original idea for the AR technology was to
								use prexisting targets, so the buildings themselves.  Environmental factors
								like the lighting, weather, and seasons, however, would change how the building
								looked to the AR camera.  With limited time to create targets we decided to
								use photographs of the buildings, and make signs in front of them for the actual event.
								</br></br>
								In order to capture good augmented reality targets, each photograph had to have unique
								contrast points as shown below.  Since many buildings shared a similar brick facade, I
								used different angles, and focus points to capture unique and interesting images.  Along
								with this, I wanted atleast one target that wasn't placed by us.  Walking around the area
								I noticed the Rutgers Shield on both banners and benches.  The shield being both simple
								and unique proved to be a great target, and the AR tracking even worked on a stained glass
								version that wasn't in the database.
