								Aerobanquets RMX is a virtual-reality art and culinary experience created by artist Mattia Casalegno
								in collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Chintan Pandya of Semma, Dhamaka, and Adda in New York.
								Aerobanquets RMX is an immersive, multisensorial, multicourse meal where guests explore, eat, and
								engage with a virtual world.  Read more about the experience <a href="https://www.aerobanquets.com/">here.</a>

								This was one of the projects I worked on as a contract worker at Pariah Interactive and was a 6-week long project.  
								This project was built in Unity using Leap Motion for hand tracking and Meta Quest 2 as the virtual reality headset. 
								Before this project most of my experience had been with developing a project from scratch, based on a storyboard or design.
								This was the first project in my professional career where I had to pick up from where someone else left off
								and add to their work, which involved a lot of structuring the flow and architecture of the project, and diving
								into Unity Timelines, to try to create a seamless experience.

								Along with restructuring the flow and architecture of the project
								I got to work on a few cool interactions using the Leap Motion and
								Quest Controllers.  One of which was eating detection.  Previously,
								servers would place the food on each user’s plate and then after the user
								had eaten, they would press a button to progress the experience. </br></br>
								To automate this, and reduce the server’s workload, I added a detection
								feature where the proximity of the plate (Quest controller) and the mouth
								(Quest headset) would be checked along with the inclination of both, as
								most users would pick up the plate, bring it to their mouth and then
								tilt it back to drop the food in.  To do this, I did various trials with
								foods such as trail mix, chocolate and snacks and recorded the inclination
								and distance at the moment the food fell into my mouth.  Based on these
								values I was able to isolate the axis on which the controller and headset
								tilted as well as determine a range for the values of rotation and distance.
								I did learn that I eat at a higher angle than many of my coworkers so I
								had to iterate on the range after doing QA tests with them but eventually
								got to a reliable range.

								Using the leap motion, I mainly focused on two different types of interactions.
								One of which was grabbing and throwing jelly-like objects and the other being
								objects floating away from the user as they approached them.  Using Leap Motion’s
								built in interaction system, most of my work was changing the physics on the
								objects themselves.  To grab and throw jelly-like objects I used Unity’s soft body
								physics system.  </br></br> The pushing objects away on hover was more interesting because I
								tried to get the direction of the force being applied based on the direction of the
								hand and settled on focusing on the index finger as I found the usual approach
								people took with interacting with a floating object would be to poke it first and and
								also used <a href="https://github.com/keijiro/ProceduralMotion">Keijiro’s Procedural Motion</a>
								package to add some movement before the person interacted with the objects.
								I was able to apply this script to a variety of objects as shown below.
