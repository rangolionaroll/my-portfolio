								Speakspace: A Virtual Listening Companion was created as a way to test whether AI could help people feel less lonely.  
								Imagine a scenario where you had a really difficult day, but you can’t stop faulting yourself for not waking up 10 
								minutes earlier so you wouldn’t be running late or preparing your bag the night before so you wouldn’t be in such a rush.  
								If you went to a friend, they would show you empathy that you at that moment wouldn’t be able to show yourself.  
								Speakspace was designed with that in mind.  In a scenario where you need to vent, but don’t want your words to affect 
								someone else, or just need reassurance about something you would be able to speak to your virtual listening companion.

								One of the main questions we tried to keep in mind while working on this was “why use this technology?”  
								Virtual reality provides a platform with full immersion.  Not only can you speak to and hear your companion 
								in a more natural way, but the space you exist in can take you away from the real world for a moment.  
								We designed our space to be dreamy, with lots of clouds, soft pinks and soft blues as shown on the left.</br></br>
								As this was a game jam, we switched and workshopped our idea quite a bit. My priorities were to teach and 
								learn as much as I could, and try to keep things simple as we had only a few hours to develop and present our idea.  
								I chose to re-use assets from our initial project and keep everything low poly.  While I was creating the room, 
								I taught my fellow teammates the basics of Blender which was used for the chairs, table and curtains and Probuilder 
								in Unity which was used for the room layout.

								The other large portion of this was our AI companion.  We decided to use Inworld to create our AI model.  
								With the use of Inworld, we were able to focus more on the content we wanted our AI to know as the character 
								creation and NPC integration into Unity were made very easy with the platform and Ready Player Me. </br></br>
								The bulk of what we taught our AI had to do with empathetic listening.  Teaching it phrases like “I understand 
								how you feel,” and “I’m here when you need me,” we tried to get it to a state where it would not offer solutions 
								or give advice but would rather focus on hearing what the player was saying and acknowledging their feelings 
								using kind and caring statements.  Also we aimed to teach our AI to ask follow-up and guiding questions to allow 
								the player to open up more.  This is shown in the text chat and video below.

								While it was a short period of time, we found our project to be quite successful.  
								During our demo time, we provided the testers with the headset and then took a step 
								back so they could keep their conversations personal.  Many people did not feel as 
								comfortable opening up in a public space, but one of the testers came up to us at the end 
								and expressed that they had shared about a difficult time that they were going through with 
								a parent.  They hadn’t expected to be able to open up as they did, but our AI asked 
								guiding questions, and reassured them about the situation.
