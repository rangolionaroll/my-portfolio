								This game was designed as a 2D choose your own adventure game in which participants
								can step into the shoes of a character who is experiencing interpersonal violence,
								and navigate through a portion of their story. In order to answer the question
								"Why don't they just leave?" the players can make decisions as the characters themselves
								and play through scenarios which show the consequences of the decisions they make.

								The objective of this project was to really convey the thoughts and emotions
								one would feel in an abusive relationship. A lot of this was done through
								the writing. The story was written in second person, so a narrator would walk
								the player through what was going on in the character's life. In order
								to help the player get into the mindset of the character, journal entries were
								added in the first person perspective so they would read thoughts such as
								"Is this my fault" in the voice of the character and reflect on the choices they have.
								</br></br>
								As an editor, I made sure that these point-of-views were kept consistent throughout the
								story, in order to ensure that the player was immersed.  Along with that, I mapped out
								the different branches and storylines to check whether details, such as a character moving
								out of an apartment, lined up through each of the story paths.  Lastly, I also edited
								for language fitting the character.  As our clients work in the field, they sometimes use
								language that sounds more clinical than a layman. A small change from "I didn't consent to this"
								to "I didn't want this" helps reflect the language of a 17-year old who hasn't learned about consent yet.

								Along with the writing, much of the story was conveyed through the art. This included
								props, characters and backgrounds to illustrate the story.  My role included breaking down
								the story to outline and create descriptions of these art assets, and also create them in
								Photoshop.
								<ul>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
										<b>Backgrounds:</b>
										To create backgrounds, I found a reference image, added any elements that needed to be in the
										scene and modified the lighting to match the time of day.  This process is shown to the right.
									</li> </br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
										<b>Characters:</b>
										To create characters, I used metahuman to get base characters.  I screenshotted several facial
										expressions, and collaged images to create the facial expressions I needed. These were then used
										as reference for the drawings.  Several facial expressions of one character are shown to the right.
									</li> </br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
										<b>Props:</b>
										While many of the props were items like a coffe cup or a remote, one of the most powerful ones to tell
										the story was a phone.  Through different phone screens, with details such as Instagram posts with
										captions and texting patterns, a lot of the story was visualized and put into a modern context.
									</li></br>
									<li align="left" style="font-size:20px;line-height:150%;">
										<b>Rotoscoping:</b>
										To tie into the theme of "In Their Shoes" we wanted to depict a player putting on a
										character's shoe.  To create this animation, I recorded a video of someone putting on a shoe
										suiting the character, picked out keyframes and drew them to animate it. One of these animations
										is shown to the right.

								The last part of the project I worked on was the website. I used a template but modified it to have
								all of the elements I wanted like a gallery the user could click into to access the games, and use
								a color scheme that fits the theme of the game and VPVA.  Along with that I created the layout, and
								all the graphics for the website. Below is an image of the original storyboard and some screenshots from
								the finished website.
